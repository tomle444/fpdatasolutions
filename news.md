	<p>Focal Pointe Data Solutions introduces its Compound Record Log Module for Hospital Pharmacy Compliance</p>

	 

	<p>CARLSBAD, CALIF. – February 25, 2015 – Focal Pointe Data Solutions, LLC, a service technology company providing data management, analytics and business intelligence solutions for hospitals, today announced the launch of its Compound Record Module. This new software solution is providing hospital pharmacies automated electronic record keeping of all compound record logs, helping them with compliance with California’s regulations on Records of Compounded Drug Products $1735.3(a) that went into effect in 2014 (for more details about the regulation see: http://www.pharmacy.ca.gov/laws_regs/1716_adopted.pdf ).

	<p>The Focal Pointe Compound Record Module pulls data directly from the leading and other IV Workflow Management products (IVWM), and generates on-demand and scheduled audit tracking reports of completed compounds. Focal Pointe will soon launch its dashboard reporting with drill-down capabilities that will integrate the Compound Record Module with the new Enterprise Report Manager platform. The Compound Record Module also provides direct dose input capabilities through input screens with a two-step remote or in-person dose verification process for doses not captured in an IVWM product or when such a product is not available.</p>

	<p>“We are excited to be able to offer an automated and efficient solution that is helping one of the largest hospital groups in San Diego meet the new legal requirements for compliance for its sterile compounding pharmacy license,” said Kevin Pettit, Focal Pointe’s President and CEO. “Regulations similar to this new compliance law, which went into effect in California last year, will soon become law in at least five other states.”</p>

	<p>Focal Pointe’s Compound Record Module enables hospitals to capture compounds not only from the automated process, but also from bypass, ad-hoc and other compounds to help hospitals become more compliant with the new regulations.</p>
