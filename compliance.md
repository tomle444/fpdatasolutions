			<p>It is becoming more difficult for hospital pharmacies to stay compliant with new regulations due to increasing demands for data capture, record-keeping and detailed reporting. The new regulations often come with significant penalties per incident of non-compliance. In addition, incidents of non-compliance if publicly known can have a serious impact on a hospital’s reputation and brand.</p> 

			
			
			

			<p><strong>Focal Pointe’s Pharmacy Pointe suite assists in regulatory compliance through the following products:</strong></p>

				<p>DoseAnalysis provides the Compound Record Compliance report of IV’s compounded in the IV room utilizing data from your IV Workflow Manager or from our DoseAssist solution. DoseAnalysis can be run on demand when requested by inspectors and can also be scheduled to run automatically and then emailed to give pharmacy leaders better insight into their IV room operations. </p>

				<p>DoseAssist allows hospital pharmacies to electronically record sterile preparations, allowing you to eliminate paper compounding logs. This helps in reducing particle counts and makes the data recorded accessible for reporting. The interface enables the compounding staff to efficiently document prepared sterile products through barcode scanning and by automatically pulling in relevant data from your IVWM. </p>

			<h4 id="DoseDirect">DoseDirect</h4>
			<div class="dose-description">
				<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/compliance_screen_3.png" class="compliance-screen"/>
				<p>DoseDirect provides IV compounding staff with a formula recipe (MFR – Master Formula Record) on how to prepare a given compounded sterile product (CSP) as well as documenting the quality review steps needed for verification. The recipe used is linked with the prepared sterile compound to enable audit tracking, compliance and reporting.  </p>
				<p>DoseDirect also can connect to your IV Workflow Manager to automatically create master formula records which can then be reviewed, edited, and approved, saving time and labor for clinical managers, pharmacy operation managers, or other pharmacy leaders, from having to create IV recipes manually. </p>
