	<h2>Optimization</h2>

 

	<p>In the era of shrinking budgets, increased workloads, and a requirement to do more with less, the need for capturing important data in real-time to help optimize your pharmacy’s compounding operations is becoming critical. Having access to the right data at the right time can significantly help hospital pharmacies improve productivity and limit any rework, waste and potentially expensive errors. </p>

	<p>Focal Pointe’s PharmacyPointe suite of optimization reports provides significant insight and knowledge into the compounding workflow and staff performance. </p> 

	<p><strong>DoseAnalysis</strong><br />
	DoseAnalysis contains selective, critical Optimization Reports that can help improve productivity and performance, and thereby lower costs and waste to improve the bottom line. DoseAnalysis offers an extensive library of reports that is continuously growing to meet the changing needs of pharmacy. </p>

	<p><strong>DoseDash </strong><br />
	DoseDash provides a dashboard solution that displays visual, relevant dashlets that can be tailored to the individual needs of hospital pharmacy staff. The dashboard includes aggregate views with the ability to drill-down into further details to gain more granular knowledge. For hospital management, the tool allows them to review the status across the entire healthcare enterprise, drill-down into each hospital and further down to specific details. It also allows you to set benchmarks on the dashlets to quickly identify if you are meeting your targets. </p> 

	<p><strong>DoseAlert </strong><br />
	DoseAlert is a set of threshold-based alerts to notify staff about critical issues pertaining to pharmacy practice when thresholds have been exceeded. This increases the efficiencies and lower costs by helping staff to be more responsive to changing conditions. </p> 

	<p><strong>DoseConnect </strong><br />
	DoseConnect is the backend technology that integrates with clients’ IV Workflow Management (IVWM) systems. DoseConnect unlocks the data in your IVWM system to enable detailed data analysis, deep operational insights, and powerful knowledge management.  </p>
